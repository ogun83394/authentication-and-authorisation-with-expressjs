## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites <a name = "installation"></a>

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
1. Set Up Node.js Environment:

Verify Installation: Check if Node.js is installed by running node -v in your terminal.
Install Missing Node.js: If not installed, download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager.

```
```
2. Navigate to Project Directory:

Open Terminal: Open your terminal or command prompt.
Change Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the "backend" folder of your project.
```
```
3. Install Project Dependencies:

Open Terminal: Ensure you're in the "backend" directory.
Install Packages: Run npm install to install the required dependencies listed in your package.json file.
Start Server: Once the installation is complete, run npm start to start the backend server.
```
```
4. Configure Code Editor:

Install Extensions: Open your code editor and install the following extensions:
SQLite3 Editor: For managing SQLite3 databases.
Live Server: For previewing HTML files in a local web server.
```
```
5. Open HTML File:

Locate File: Navigate to the "web-front-end/pages" directory and open the "index.html" file.
Start Live Server: Right-click on the "index.html" file and select the "Open with Live Server" option (or use a keyboard shortcut if available). This will launch a local web server and open the file in your default browser.
